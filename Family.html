        <p>My Family and Me</p>
    </div>

    <div class="info">
            <p>I have 3 children, one boy and 2 girls</p>
            <p>My boy is 13 years old and loves video games and would play all day every day if we let him...Just like
                most other teenage boys! He certainly tests our patience, but what 13 year old doesn't?</p>
            <p>My girls are 2 and 4, and both LOVE everything sparkly, princess and girly, but will also play with worms
                and make you question where all the dirt came from and how it was possible to get that much on their
                tiny bodies!</p>
            <p>I was born in San Bernadino, California, when my sister and I were babies, my parents decided to move to
                Traverse City, Michigan, and that's where I was raised!</p>
            <p>When I met my fiance Line Dancing, we lived in different states, I eventually moved to Indianapolis with
                my (then) 6 year old son! After moving I was a Stay at Home mom for about 6 years!</p>
            <p>After weighing our options, we decided I needed some technical skills so I could eventually hit the
                ground running to save for retirement, so here I am!</p>
